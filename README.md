## The programmable API for usage-based billing
[![Lago Billing System Presentation](https://img.youtube.com/vi/dXnoMRetsr4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXnoMRetsr4)

### The problem: Billing systems are still a nightmare for engineers
![Billing nightmare](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6244531a40ad7ef5475ad9b3/62827b2f6fa52239b0db0fa4_Blog%20Post%20Image%20Standalone.png)
Engineers be like…

**The Solution:** Lago, the open-source billing API for product-led SaaS
- Event-based: if you can track it, you can charge for it;
- Built for product-led growth companies;
- Hybrid pricing: subscription and usage;
- Hybrid go-to-market motion: self-serve and sales-led.

**Open-source, open architecture:**
- Composable: connect Lago to any of your internal systems or tools (i.e. any payment gateway, CRM, CPQ, accounting software);
- Pricing: we’re not rent seekers, we’re not asking for a % of your revenue. Our self-hosted version is free. Our cloud version is priced like a SaaS;
- Privacy: your data never has to leave your infrastructure.

## ✨ Features
- **[Usage metering](https://www.getlago.com/products/metering)**: Lago's event-based architecture provides a solid foundation for building a fair pricing model that scales with your business.
- **[Price plans](https://www.getlago.com/products/plans)**: Lago supports all pricing models. Create pay-as-you-go and hybrid plans in no time with our intuitive user interface or API.
- **[Coupons](https://www.getlago.com/products/coupons)**: Create engaging marketing campaigns and increase conversion with coupons that customers can redeem to get a discount.
- **[Add-ons](https://www.getlago.com/products/add-on)**: Why wait until the end of the billing cycle to get paid? Lago allows you to create one-time charges that are invoiced on the fly.
- **[Invoicing](https://www.getlago.com/products/invoicing)**: Depending on the configuration of your plans, Lago automatically calculates what each customer owes you and generates invoices.
- **[Prepaid credits](https://www.getlago.com/products/prepaid-credits)**: Unlock recurring revenue opportunities for pay-as-you-go pricing models with Lago's prepaid credit features.

## 📚 Documentation
- **[Development Environment](./docs/development.md)**: Learn how to set up and run Lago locally for development

## 💻 Deploy locally

### Requirements
1. Install Docker on your machine;
2. Make sure Docker Compose is installed and available (it should be the case if you have chosen to install Docker via Docker Desktop); and
3. Make sure Git is installed on your machine.

### Run the app
To start using Lago, run the following commands in a shell:


#### On a fresh install
```bash
# Get the code
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/getlago/lago.git

# Go to Lago folder
cd lago

# Set up environment configuration
echo "LAGO_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY=\"`openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl base64 -A`\"" >> .env
source .env

# Start all the components
docker compose up
```

#### After an update

```bash
docker compose up
```

You can now open your browser and go to http://localhost to connect to the application. Lago's API is exposed at http://localhost:3000.

Note that if our docker server is not at http://localhost, the following env variables must be set: `LAGO_API_URL`. This may be on the command line or in your .env file. For example:

```
LAGO_API_URL="http://192.168.122.71:3000"
LAGO_FRONT_URL="http://192.168.122.71"
```

### Find your API key
Your API Key can be found directly in the UI:

1. Access the **Developer** section from the sidebar;
2. The first tab of this section is related to your **API keys**; and
3. Click the **Copy** button to copy it to clipboard.

### Analytics and tracking
Please note that Lago, by default, tracks basic actions performed on your self-hosted instance. If you do not disable tracking, you may receive specific communications or product updates. However, rest assured that Lago will not collect any personal information about your customers or financial information about your invoices.

If you would like to know more about Lago's analytics or remove the entire tracking, please refer to [this page](https://doc.getlago.com/guide/self-hosted/tracking-analytics) for comprehensive information.

### Version, environment variables and components
Docker images are always updated to the last stable version in the docker-compose.yml file. You can use a different tag if needed by checking the releases list.

Lago uses the following environment variables to configure the components of the application. You can override them to customise your setup. Take a closer look are our [documentation](https://doc.getlago.com/docs/guide/self-hosting/docker#configuration).

## 💡 Philosophy
B2B SaaS has evolved, but billing has not yet.

### 1- We’re not in the “subscription economy” anymore. And we won’t go “full usage-based pricing” quite yet
Pricings are now mostly hybrid: they include a usage-based component (i.e. “if you use more you pay more”) and a subscription component (i.e. a recurring fee for basic usage).

Not all software companies will go full “usage-based” like Snowflake for instance. This model is the new standard for cloud infrastructure products. However, in other areas of SaaS, users want to know beforehand how much they will pay to control their spending and software companies want to be able to predict recurring revenues.

### 2- Go-to-market is not either bottom-up or top-down anymore
SaaS used to be either self-service (SMBs) or sales-led (Enterprises).
Go-to-market now mixes the self-service (all customers access the same price plans) and sales-led (customers get a custom quote from a sales representative) motions.
A typical journey involves an individual contributor in a company who tests a new tool, puts their corporate credit card in, and starts spreading the use of the tool within the organization. At that point, the VP or head of department might want to upgrade to a custom plan tailored to the needs of the whole organization.
As a result, billing needs to be flexible, automated, and transparent enough to embrace this hybrid go-to-market motion as well.

### 3- The “rent seeker” pricing of current billing solutions needs to stop
Why do payment companies take a cut on revenues?
Because the higher the amount, the higher the risk for them (e.g. fraud, disputes, etc.).

Why did billing companies adopt the same pricing structure? We’re not able to provide an answer that makes sense. It’s been said on the internet that they did this because they could (read more [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16766846)).

### One last thing…
Lago is agnostic and we aim at being as transparent as possible, so we won’t nudge or lock you into using a specific tool in exchange for using our billing API ([learn more](https://www.gmass.co/blog/negotiating-stripe-fees/)).
